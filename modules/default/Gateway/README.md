# Gateway

`MMM-GoogleAssistant` need an gateway for comunicate with plugins.<br>
So `Gateway` will doing this job !

# Why `Gateway` is needed ?

When you use an some media modules  (music, video, photos,...) some weird things can happen
I think, many people have this problem:
 * I can run 2 media modules at the time
 * pir sensor don't detect media... so screen turn off
 
So `Gateway` is your fiend

Gateway is able to:
 * Lock your screen when a plugins is playing and prohibit going into sleep mode
 * Prohibit to use 2 plugins in sametime (can't listen Spotify and watch YouTube at the same time for exemple)
 * Turn off all not needed plugins and keep the last plugin demand
 * Unlock your screen and return in normal mode when no plugins are used
 * Read MMM-GoogleAssistant response and launch automaticaly a plugins (photo, browser, youtube...)


All name of `MMM-GoogleAssistant` plugins start with `EXT` and the `Gateway` will apply many rules for make deal between `MMM-GoogleAssistant` and plugins

`Gateway` have a database of ALL `EXT` plugins for apply self rules.
